  - ``--since`` option to control query date range (default: 7 days)
  - ``--forget`` flag to remove tracking and clean up lei queries
  - Configuration stored in conf.d/ for easy management

* Modular Configuration (conf.d)

  - Additional config files automatically loaded from ``~/.config/korgalore/conf.d/*.toml``
  - Files merged alphabetically into main configuration
  - Useful for separating auto-generated configs from manual configuration

* Pipe Target

  - New target type for delivering messages to external commands
  - Labels passed as command-line arguments to the pipe command
  - Useful for custom processing pipelines

* TOML Validation

  - ``edit-config`` command now validates syntax after editor closes

  - CLI options: ``--add``, ``--edit``, ``--list``, ``--reason``

* Suppress googleapiclient discovery cache warning by disabling file_cache

* Defer feed initialization messages until after progressbar completes for
  cleaner output

* Add comprehensive test suite with 300+ tests

* Optimize delivery lookup algorithms for better performance
